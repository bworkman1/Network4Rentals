First you will need to create a database -
phpmyadmin -> name it to whatever you want...

Next import the database file to your newly created database 
To import it you won't be able to use the upload through phpmyadmin
Add mysql.exe to your path variable in windows
1.) locate your mysql.exe file. Mine was located in C:\MAMP\bin\mysql\bin yours will be similar.
2.) Open a folder and on the left side right click on "This PC" and go to properties
3.) Left side click on "Advanced System Settings"
4.) Click on "Environment Variables" button
5.) Bottom box scroll down to the Path and add your mysql.exe full path including the C:/ They are seperated by ;
6.) Open command prompt and type mysql -v. copyright and stuff pops up you did it :) If not make sure your mamp/wamp is on.
7.) In command prompt navigate to the directory this file is.
8.) mysqldump -u root -p [DATA_BASENAME] > database.sql 
9.) It should ask for a password and then see some matrix stuff. Wait for it to finish.

DATABASE IMPORT DONE


There is going to be a whole bunch of issues for now. Most of them will be that the links are not pointing to your local url. This can be fixed by using base_url('file/name');
